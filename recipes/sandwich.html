        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. They are really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>1 cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>16 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>16 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
            <li>2 cups sauerkraut, drained</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing.</li>
            <li>On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
